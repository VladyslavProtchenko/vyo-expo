PHASE: ${phase}
AVAILABLE PRODUCTS LIST (COMPLETE AND FINAL):
${actualProducts}${previousListsText}

### YOUR TASK:
Generate ONLY 1 optimal set of 9 products maximally balanced for the ${phase} phase.

⚠️ CRITICAL RULES - MUST FOLLOW:
1. You MUST use ONLY products from the AVAILABLE PRODUCTS LIST above
2. DO NOT add, invent, or suggest ANY products not in the list
3. DO NOT use similar products (e.g., if "quinoa" is not listed, you CANNOT use it)
4. Copy product names EXACTLY as written (including capitalization: "Baked salmon", "Boiled egg", etc.)
5. Return ONLY ONE list of exactly 9 unique products
6. Return ONLY a JSON array, no explanations or additional text

### SELECTION CRITERIA (in priority order):
1. **Nutrient Density**: Maximum coverage of phase-specific nutrients (Fe, Mg, Ω3, B vitamins, etc.)
2. **Bioavailability**: heme iron > non-heme iron, pair plant iron with Vitamin C sources
3. **Food Synergy**: Choose products that work well together and enhance each other's absorption
4. **Variety**: Mix different food groups (proteins, vegetables, fruits, nuts, grains)
5. **Anti-inflammatory**: For endometriosis management
6. **Digestive Tolerance**: Prefer cooked/warm foods during menstrual; avoid high-histamine during ovulation
7. **Diversity from previous lists**: If previous lists exist, create a different combination

### PHASE-SPECIFIC PHYSIOLOGY:
- **Menstrual**: Blood replenishment (Iron, B12), muscle relaxation (Magnesium). Prefer cooked foods.
- **Follicular**: Energy rebuilding (B vitamins), gut health (Choline). Light proteins + complex carbs.
- **Ovulatory**: Estrogen metabolism (Fiber, Sulfur amino acids), antioxidant protection.
- **Luteal**: Blood sugar stability (Magnesium, B6, Fiber), inflammation control (Omega-3, Vitamin E).

### COMPOSITION (must include):
- 2-3 Protein sources (meat/fish/eggs/legumes/tofu)
- 3-4 Fiber/Vitamin sources (vegetables/fruits/greens)
- 1-2 Healthy fats (seeds/nuts/avocado/oils)
- 1-2 Complex carbs (grains/potatoes/bread)

### STRICT CONSTRAINTS:
✓ Use ONLY products from the AVAILABLE PRODUCTS list
✓ Exactly 9 unique products
✓ All names in lowercase exactly as shown in the list
✓ Products must complement each other nutritionally
✓ Return ONLY ONE JSON array

### OUTPUT FORMAT:
["product1", "product2", "product3", "product4", "product5", "product6", "product7", "product8", "product9"]

REMINDER: Use ONLY products from the list above. Match names EXACTLY (with capital letters). Return ONLY the JSON array.`;
